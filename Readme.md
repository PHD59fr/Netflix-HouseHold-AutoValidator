# Netflix HouseHold Auto-Validator

## üìù Description

This application monitors an IMAP mailbox for emails from Netflix links. It is designed to automate the process of verifying the primary location for Netflix accounts.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration
**Edit the `config.yaml` file at the root of the project with the following structure:**

   ```yaml
   netflixAuth:
     - email: "your-netflix-email@example.com" #Optional
       password: "your-netflix-password" #Optional
     - email: "your-netflix-email2@example.com" #Optional
       password: "your-netflix-password2" #Optional

   filterByAccount: false # if true, the application will only process emails that match the email addresses in the netflixAuth section
   email:
     imap: "imap.example.com:993"
     login: "your-email@example.com"
     password: "your-email-password"
     refreshTime: 20
     mailbox: "INBOX"
   expiredLinkMessage: "Ce lien n'est plus valide"
   targetFrom: "info@account.netflix.com"
   targetSubject: "Important¬†: comment mettre √† jour votre foyer Netflix"
   ```

   **Note:** Make sure to replace the values with your own information.
